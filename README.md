# Statistically-Optimal-Wordle

[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) is all the rage these days. If you're reading this, you probably already know the rules of the game. You get six guesses at a hidden five-letter word randomly selected each day. Each guess must itself be a legitimate five-letter word, and as feedback, you learn whether each letter in your guess is 1. in the target word and in the correct location (`green`), 2. in the target word but not in the correct location (`yellow`), or 3. not in the target word at all (`black`). 

This is my Wordle game from yesterday:
